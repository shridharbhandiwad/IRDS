# Track Visualization Features - Implementation Changes

## Summary
Implemented four major track visualization features:
1. Speed vector proportional to track velocity
2. Track highlight functionality with size increase
3. Track deletion capability
4. Track focus with persistent tooltip that follows position

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `globalstructs.h`
**Changes:** Added two boolean flags to `stTrackDisplayInfo` structure

```cpp
struct stTrackDisplayInfo {
    // ... existing fields ...
    bool isHighlighted;         //!< Flag for highlighting track
    bool isFocused;             //!< Flag for focused track (always show tooltip)
};
```

**Purpose:** Track state management for highlighting and focusing

---

### 2. `cdatawarehouse.h`
**Changes:** Added 5 new public methods and 1 private member

```cpp
// New methods
void deleteTrack(int trackId);
void highlightTrack(int trackId, bool highlight);
void focusTrack(int trackId);
void unfocusAllTracks();
int getFocusedTrackId() const;

// New member
int _m_nFocusedTrackId; //!< ID of currently focused track (-1 if none)
```

**Purpose:** Data management for new track states

---

### 3. `cdatawarehouse.cpp`
**Changes:** 
- Modified constructor to initialize `_m_nFocusedTrackId`
- Modified `slotUpdateTrackData()` to initialize new flags and store velocity
- Implemented 5 new methods

#### New Method Implementations:

**`deleteTrack(int trackId)`**
- Removes track from `_m_listTrackInfo` hash
- Clears focus if deleted track was focused
- Logs deletion to console

**`highlightTrack(int trackId, bool highlight)`**
- Sets `isHighlighted` flag for specified track
- Allows multiple tracks to be highlighted

**`focusTrack(int trackId)`**
- Unfocuses all other tracks first (only one can be focused)
- Sets `isFocused` flag for specified track
- Updates `_m_nFocusedTrackId`

**`unfocusAllTracks()`**
- Clears `isFocused` flag for all tracks
- Resets `_m_nFocusedTrackId` to -1

**`getFocusedTrackId()`**
- Returns ID of currently focused track or -1

**Key Change in Data Update:**
```cpp
info.velocity = trackRecvInfo.velocity;  // Now stored for vector calculation
info.isHighlighted = false;              // Initialize for new tracks
info.isFocused = false;                  // Initialize for new tracks
```

---

### 4. `MapDisplay/ctracklayer.cpp`
**Changes:** Major modifications to paint() method and context menu handlers

#### Context Menu Updates:
- Updated menu item text for clarity
- `onFocusTrack()`: Now toggles focus on/off
- `onDeleteTrack()`: Now functional (calls data warehouse)
- `onHighlightTrack()`: Now functional (toggles highlight state)

#### Paint Method Changes:

**1. Speed Vector (Lines ~648-681)**
```cpp
// Calculate length based on velocity
double velocityScale = 2.0; // pixels per m/s
double vectorLength = track.velocity * velocityScale;

// Clamp for visibility
if (vectorLength < 5) vectorLength = 5;
if (vectorLength > 50) vectorLength = 50;

// Draw vector with arrowhead
// ... vector and arrow drawing code ...
```

**2. Size Multiplier System (Lines ~604-611)**
```cpp
double sizeMultiplier = 1.0;
if (isHighlighted) {
    sizeMultiplier = 1.8; // Highlighted tracks are 80% larger
}
if (isFocused) {
    sizeMultiplier = 2.0; // Focused tracks are even larger
}
```

**3. Highlight Visual Effects (Lines ~623-628)**
```cpp
if (isHighlighted) {
    // Bright colored ring at 12px
    // White outer ring at 14px
}
```

**4. Focus Visual Effects (Lines ~614-622)**
```cpp
if (isFocused) {
    // Pulsing circles animation (15-25px radius)
    // Cyan and white rings
}
```

**5. Tooltip for Focused Track (Lines ~765-768)**
```cpp
// Draw tooltip for focused track (always visible, follows track position)
if (hasFocusedTrack) {
    QPointF focusedScreen = mapToPixel.transform(
        QgsPointXY(focusedTrack.lon, focusedTrack.lat)).toQPointF();
    drawTooltip(pPainter, focusedTrack, focusedScreen);
}
```

**6. Apply Size Multiplier (Throughout paint method)**
```cpp
double dotSize = 4 * sizeMultiplier;           // Core dot
QPen vectorPen(clr, 2 * sizeMultiplier);       // Vector line
double arrowSize = 4 * sizeMultiplier;         // Arrow head
if (isHighlighted || isFocused) {
    fontSize = 13;                              // Label font
    fontWeight = QFont::Bold;
}
```

## Logic Flow

### Highlight Track:
1. User right-clicks track ‚Üí context menu appears
2. User clicks "‚ú® Toggle Highlight"
3. `onHighlightTrack()` checks current state
4. Calls `CDataWarehouse::highlightTrack()` with toggled state
5. Paint method detects `isHighlighted` flag
6. Applies 1.8x size multiplier and visual rings

### Focus Track:
1. User right-clicks track ‚Üí context menu appears
2. User clicks "üéØ Toggle Focus"
3. `onFocusTrack()` checks if already focused
4. If not focused: calls `CDataWarehouse::focusTrack()` + centers map
5. If focused: calls `CDataWarehouse::unfocusAllTracks()`
6. Paint method detects `isFocused` flag
7. Applies 2.0x size multiplier, pulsing animation, and persistent tooltip

### Delete Track:
1. User right-clicks track ‚Üí context menu appears
2. User clicks "üóëÔ∏è Delete Track"
3. `onDeleteTrack()` calls `CDataWarehouse::deleteTrack()`
4. Data warehouse removes track from hash
5. If track was focused, clears focus
6. Canvas redraws without deleted track

### Speed Vector:
1. Track data updated with velocity value
2. Paint method calculates vector length: `velocity √ó 2.0` pixels
3. Clamps between 5-50 pixels
4. Draws line from track center to calculated endpoint
5. Draws arrowhead at endpoint indicating direction
6. Vector thickness scales with track size multiplier

## State Priority

When multiple states are active on a single track:
1. **Focused** takes visual precedence (2.0x size, pulsing animation)
2. **Highlighted** is secondary (1.8x size, if not focused)
3. **Hovered** is tertiary (subtle rings, doesn't override focused/highlighted)

---

## Animation

- **Frame counter:** `nAnimFrame` (0-19, updates every 150ms)
- **Pulsing effect:** `pulseRadius = 15 + (nAnimFrame % 10)` (15-24px)
- **Fade effect:** Used in standard blip animation (existing)

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Tooltip rendering:** Only renders for hovered track OR focused track (not both)
- **State checks:** Boolean flags checked once per track per frame
- **Vector calculation:** Simple arithmetic, no complex math
- **Memory:** Two additional booleans per track (minimal overhead)

---

## Testing Notes

Default test tracks (defined in cdatawarehouse.cpp):
- Track 1: velocity = 20 m/s ‚Üí ~40px vector
- Track 2: velocity = 20 m/s ‚Üí ~40px vector  
- Track 3: velocity = 35 m/s ‚Üí ~50px vector (at max clamp)

All features are toggleable via right-click context menu on any track.

---

## Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved:
- Track history system still works
- Hover tooltips still work
- Track identification colors unchanged
- Map zoom/pan interactions unchanged
- Animation system unchanged

---

## Code Quality

‚úÖ **No linter errors**
‚úÖ **Consistent with existing code style**
‚úÖ **Uses Qt framework properly** (qDegreesToRadians, etc.)
‚úÖ **Memory management** (proper initialization, cleanup)
‚úÖ **Thread safety** (singleton pattern maintained)
‚úÖ **Debug logging** (all actions logged to console)

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential additions based on current implementation:
- Save highlight/focus state persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts for track actions
- Multiple track focus support
- Custom velocity scaling factor in UI
- Track image display (menu item exists, functionality not implemented)
- Export highlighted tracks to file
