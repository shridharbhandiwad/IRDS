# Drone Image Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds drone image visualization and movement animation to the radar display system. Tracks can now be displayed as drone images that rotate according to their heading and move smoothly across the display.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Drone Image Creation
- **Default Drone Image**: Programmatically created drone image with realistic details:
  - Main fuselage with gradient shading
  - Four arms extending from center
  - Propellers with spinning effect
  - LED lights (green front, red rear)
  - Camera/gimbal underneath
  - Direction indicator arrow
  - Shadow/glow effect

### 2. Image Management
- **Custom Images**: Users can load custom images for specific tracks
- **Automatic Scaling**: Images are automatically scaled to 32x32 or 40x40 pixels
- **Image Storage**: Track images are stored in a QMap for efficient access

### 3. Movement and Rotation
- **Heading-Based Rotation**: Drone images rotate according to track heading
- **Smooth Animation**: Interpolated movement between position updates
- **Easing Function**: Ease-out animation for natural movement
- **Animation Progress**: Tracks previous positions for smooth transitions

### 4. Visual Enhancements
- **Drone-Specific Animation**: Different glow effects for drone vs regular tracks
- **Pulsing Glow**: Blue-cyan gradient glow for drone tracks
- **Enhanced Speed Vectors**: Improved speed vector display with arrowheads
- **LED Effects**: Colored LED indicators on drone arms

### 5. Context Menu Integration
- **Create Drone**: Convert regular track to drone track
- **Remove Drone**: Convert drone track back to regular track
- **Load Custom Image**: Load custom image for specific track
- **Image Management**: Automatic cleanup when drones are removed

## Code Structure

### Header Files Modified
- `MapDisplay/ctracklayer.h`: Added drone image functionality
- `cdatawarehouse.h`: Added drone removal method

### Implementation Files Modified
- `MapDisplay/ctracklayer.cpp`: Main drone image implementation
- `cdatawarehouse.cpp`: Added drone removal functionality

### Key Methods Added

#### CTrackLayer Class
```cpp
QPixmap createDefaultDroneImage();
void drawDroneImage(QPainter *pPainter, const stTrackDisplayInfo &trackInfo, 
                   const QPointF &screenPos, const QPixmap &image);
QPointF getAnimatedPosition(int trackId, const QPointF &currentPos);
void onCreateDroneForTrack();
void onRemoveDroneFromTrack();
```

#### CDataWarehouse Class
```cpp
void removeDroneFromTrack(int trackId);
```

## Usage Instructions

### Creating Drone Images
1. Right-click on any track in the display
2. Select "üöÅ Create Drone for Track" from context menu
3. Track will immediately display as a drone image
4. Drone image will rotate based on track heading

### Loading Custom Images
1. Right-click on any track
2. Select "üñºÔ∏è Load Track Image" from context menu
3. Choose an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF)
4. Image will be scaled and applied to the track

### Removing Drone Images
1. Right-click on a drone track
2. Select "‚ùå Remove Drone from Track" from context menu
3. Track will revert to standard dot display

## Technical Details

### Image Rotation
- Uses QPainter transformation matrix
- Converts geographical heading (0¬∞ = North) to screen rotation
- Rotation formula: `90¬∞ - heading` for proper alignment

### Animation System
- 150ms timer updates (‚âà6.7 FPS)
- Stores previous and current positions
- Uses ease-out function: `1.0 - (1.0 - progress)¬≤`
- Smooth interpolation between position updates

### Memory Management
- Images stored in QMap<int, QPixmap>
- Automatic cleanup when tracks are deleted
- Drone objects properly deleted when removed

### Visual Effects
- Different glow animations for drone vs regular tracks
- Enhanced propeller spinning effects
- LED lighting simulation
- Realistic shadow and gradient effects

## Dependencies
- Qt5 Core, GUI, Widgets
- QGIS Core and GUI libraries
- QPainter for 2D graphics
- QPixmap for image handling

## Performance Considerations
- Images cached in memory for fast access
- Efficient QMap lookup for track images
- Minimal computational overhead for rotation
- Smooth animation without performance impact

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple drone types with different images
- Animated propeller rotation
- Trail effects for drone movement
- Battery level visualization on drone image
- Formation flight patterns
- 3D perspective effects

## Example Usage Code

### Creating a Drone Programmatically
```cpp
// Create drone for track ID 123
CDataWarehouse::getInstance()->createDroneForTrack(123);

// The track will now display as a drone image and rotate based on heading
```

### Checking if Track has Drone
```cpp
// Get track information
QList<stTrackDisplayInfo> tracks = CDataWarehouse::getInstance()->getTrackList();
for (const stTrackDisplayInfo &track : tracks) {
    if (track.pDrone != nullptr) {
        qDebug() << "Track" << track.nTrkId << "is a drone";
        // Access drone internal state
        stDroneInternalState state = track.pDrone->getInternalState();
        qDebug() << "Battery level:" << state.batteryLevel << "%";
    }
}
```

## Testing
The implementation has been designed and coded but requires a proper Qt5 development environment for compilation and testing. All code follows Qt and C++ best practices and should compile without issues when dependencies are available.

### Build Requirements
- Qt5 development packages (qtbase5-dev, qt5-qmake)
- QGIS development libraries
- C++11 compatible compiler

### Expected Behavior
1. Tracks display as traditional dots by default
2. Right-click context menu provides drone creation option
3. Drone tracks display as detailed drone images
4. Images rotate smoothly based on track heading
5. Smooth movement animation between position updates
6. Different visual effects for drone vs regular tracks
